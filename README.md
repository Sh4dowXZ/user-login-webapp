# 🔐 Byte-Pass

Welcome to my first **Flask-based** project! <br>
This web app allows users to register and log in securely using a **SQLite database** and **hashed passwords**.

## ✨ Features

-  User registration with form validation
-  Secure password hashing using `werkzeug.security`
-  Login system that checks hashed credentials
-  SQLite database integration
-  Beginner-friendly code with clear comments
-  Built 100% from scratch and deployed to GitHub!

## 💻 How-To

- **Clone** the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sh4dowXZ/user-login-webapp.git
   ```
- **Access BytePass** from your browser:<br>
  ➡ [https://bytepass.onrender.com/register](https://bytepass.onrender.com/register)


## 📜 Credits
