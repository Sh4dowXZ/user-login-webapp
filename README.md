This web app allows users to register and log in securely using a **SQLite database** and **hashed passwords**.

## ✨ Features

-  User registration with form validation
-  Secure password hashing using `werkzeug.security`
-  Login system that checks hashed credentials
-  SQLite database integration
-  Beginner-friendly code with clear comments
-  Built 100% from scratch and deployed to GitHub!

## 💻 How-To

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sh4dowXZ/user-login-webapp.git

## 📜 Credits
